# How to run this project

## Infos

1 - First, beware some text haven't been reviewed in the notebook files, so you will find some errors

2 - The project itself is a post, so you only need to run the notebook and re-run the cells to see the results :smile:

## Steps
Run 
```
pipenv shell # Create a virtualenv, I've done it with pipenv
pipenv install # This will install the dependencies, may take a while
jupyter notebook # Will start and open the notebook
```
Then select the `.pynb` file and run the cells to check the results
